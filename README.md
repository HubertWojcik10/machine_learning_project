# Machine Learning - CNN, DT, NN implementation
A Machine Learning university project, where we create our own investigations of a neural network and a decision tree. We also used PyTorch to create a CNN. Our task was to classify different types of clothing based on an image of the item.

## Important Details 
- group work: we worked in pairs
- the submission was code + report, which then was discussed individually in the exam
- dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist

## What I would do different?
- I would add one more layer to the nn
- I would use ReLU as an activation function, but softmax as the last activation function
- I would use MiniBatch GD in a different way
